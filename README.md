Symfony project to digitally classify camera negative pages in their real-life binders.

In a second time the goal is to have the possibility to add scans of frames from negatives/slides/film sheets.

Finally we'll be able to find the binder where the neagative page we are lookig for.

Or just to browse a negative film like a scans gallery to find a scan.

And we will have the path to the scan on the driveo of course.
